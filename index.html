    <strong>About Me</strong>
</font>

<p class="small">
I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). 
My academic journey is complemented by a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIIT-Delhi). <br />
<br />
With a strong foundation in data science, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP), 
I focus on applying these skills to real-world challenges, particularly in understanding social science phenomena. 
My recent research explores toxicity trends in political debates across different cultures using advanced NLP techniques.
<br />
<br />
Driven by curiosity and a passion for impactful work, I thrive on solving complex problems and transforming raw data into actionable insights.

<strong>Skills and Expertise</strong>
</font>

<p class="small">
I possess a versatile skill set encompassing various aspects of data science, including machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization. 
My proficiency extends to programming languages such as Python, R, and Java, which serve as powerful tools for implementing machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis. 
With a deep understanding of popular data science frameworks like Scikit-learn, Pandas, Keras, PyTorch, and Numpy, I can develop and deploy robust machine learning models. <br />
<br />
In addition to machine learning, I excel in data analysis techniques, allowing me to uncover valuable insights from complex datasets. 
Proficient in data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering, I ensure that the data is properly prepared for modeling and analysis. 
My expertise extends to using statistical techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful patterns, identify trends, and gain a comprehensive understanding of the data. <br />
<br />
To effectively communicate the findings and tell compelling data-driven stories, I leverage data visualization tools such as Tableau. With these tools, I create visually engaging charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards that facilitate clear and intuitive data exploration. 
This combination of technical skills and storytelling ability enables me to present complex analyses in a visually appealing and accessible manner. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, my knowledge extends to utilizing databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Neo4j, allowing me to efficiently manage and manipulate large-scale datasets. 
I am experienced in SQL querying and proficient in data retrieval, transformation, and integration from diverse sources. This comprehensive understanding of databases enhances my ability to work with structured and unstructured data and enables me to derive valuable insights from them.

<strong>Beyond Data and Code</strong>
</font>

<p class="small">
Outside of my professional endeavors, I am passionate about sports such as cricket, basketball, Formula 1, and soccer. 
These interests enhance my analytical thinking and strategic skills, which seamlessly translate into my data science work. <br />
<br />
As a freelance photographer, I capture stories through my lens, expressing creativity in visual storytelling. 
This pursuit enriches my ability to observe, analyze, and appreciate intricate details—skills that I carry into my professional life.
