    <strong>About Me</strong>
</font>

<p class="small">
I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), where I am expanding my knowledge and skills in the field. <br />
<br />
With a strong background in Computer Science and Engineering from Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi, 
I have developed a passion for harnessing the power of data to derive valuable insights and make informed decisions. <br />
<br />
My journey in data science has equipped me with a diverse set of skills and experiences, 
allowing me to tackle complex problems and deliver innovative solutions.

<strong>Skills and Expertise</strong>
</font>

<p class="small">
I possess a versatile skill set encompassing various aspects of data science, including machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization. 
My proficiency extends to programming languages such as Python, R, and Java, which serve as powerful tools for implementing machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis. 
With a deep understanding of popular data science frameworks like Scikit-learn, Pandas, Keras, PyTorch, and Numpy, I can develop and deploy robust machine learning models. <br />
<br />
In addition to machine learning, I excel in data analysis techniques, allowing me to uncover valuable insights from complex datasets. 
Proficient in data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering, I ensure that the data is properly prepared for modeling and analysis. 
My expertise extends to using statistical techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful patterns, identify trends, and gain a comprehensive understanding of the data. <br />
<br />
To effectively communicate the findings and tell compelling data-driven stories, I leverage data visualization tools such as Tableau. With these tools, I create visually engaging charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards that facilitate clear and intuitive data exploration. 
This combination of technical skills and storytelling ability enables me to present complex analyses in a visually appealing and accessible manner. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, my knowledge extends to utilizing databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Neo4j, allowing me to efficiently manage and manipulate large-scale datasets. 
I am experienced in SQL querying and proficient in data retrieval, transformation, and integration from diverse sources. This comprehensive understanding of databases enhances my ability to work with structured and unstructured data and enables me to derive valuable insights from them.

<strong>Creative Explorations</strong>
</font>

<p class="small">
Beyond my data science endeavors, I am an avid sports geek with a deep passion for sports like cricket, basketball, soccer, and F1. 
Following these sports not only provides me with entertainment but also nurtures my ability to analyze patterns, strategize, and think criticallyâ€”skills that seamlessly translate into the field of data science. <br />
<br />
Photography serves as a creative outlet for me, enabling me to capture the world through a lens. As a freelance photographer, I have honed my skills in visual storytelling, composition, and post-processing. 
Through photography, I am able to express my creativity, observe and appreciate the beauty in everyday life, and communicate narratives that resonate with viewers.
