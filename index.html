    <strong>About Me</strong>
</font>

<p class="small">
I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), where Iâ€™ve maintained a perfect 4.0 GPA. 
My academic journey is complemented by a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi. <br />
<br />
With a strong foundation in data science, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP), 
I focus on applying these skills to real-world challenges, particularly in understanding social science phenomena. 
My recent research explores toxicity trends in political debates across cultures using advanced NLP techniques. 
<br />
<br />
Driven by curiosity and a passion for impactful work, I thrive on solving complex problems and transforming raw data into actionable insights.
