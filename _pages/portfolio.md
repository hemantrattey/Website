    title: "Diabetic Patient Readmission Prediction"
    text: "Patient Readmission Prediction is a data-driven project aimed at improving patient outcomes in hospitals. It involves analyzing electronic health records from 130 US hospitals over a decade, covering more than 100,000 patients. The dataset, published by <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008' style='color:blue'>UCI</a>, serves as the foundation for creating a robust data pipeline for cleaning and preprocessing the data. By using simple yet effective machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, the project achieved promising results with a 72% F1-score, 81% Precision, and 67% Recall. This predictive model provides hospitals with insights to better manage patient care and reduce readmission rates."
